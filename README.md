# MSBooster
Last updated: 9/30/2024

## Overview
MSBooster is a tool for incorporating spectral libary predictions into peptide-spectrum match (PSM) 
rescoring in bottom-up tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry proteomics data. It is roughly
broken into 4 steps:
1. Peptide extraction from PSMs in search results, and formatting for machine/deep learning (ML/DL) 
predictors' input files
2. Calling the prediction model(s) and saving the output
3. Feature calculation
4. Addition of new features to the search results file

MSBooster is compatible with many types of database searches, including HLA immunopeptidomics, DDA and
DIA, and single cell proteomics. It is incorporated into [FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/) 
and is included in many of its workflows. MSBooster was developed with other FragPipe tools in mind, 
such as FragPipe-PDV.

## Accepted inputs and models
MSBooster is equipped to handle multiple input file formats and models:

| Mass spectrometer output |
| --- |
| .mzML |
| .mgf |

| PSM file |
| --- |
| .pin |
| .pepXML (in progress) |

| Prediction model                             |

| [DIA-NN](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN) |
| [Koina models](Koina.md)                     |

## Installation and running guide
### In FragPipe
MSBooster can be run in Windows and Linux systems. If using FragPipe, no other installation steps are
needed besides installing FragPipe. MSBooster is located in the "Validation" tab. Choose to enable 
retention time features with "Predict RT" and MS/MS spectral features with "Predict spectra". Please refer to the 
[FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/) documentation for how to run an analysis.

### On the command line
If using standalone MSBooster to run in the command line, please download the latest jar file from 
Releases. MSBooster also requires DIA-NN for MS/MS and RT prediction. Please install 
[DIA-NN](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN) and take note of the path to the DIA-NN executable 
(ex. DiaNN.exe for Windows, diann-1.8.1.8 for Linux).

You can run MSBooster using a command similar to the following: 

    java -jar MSBooster-1.2.1.jar --paramsList msbooster_params.txt
    
The minimum parameters needing to be passed are:

    - DiaNN (String): path to DIA-NN executable (if using DIA-NN model, which is the MSBooster default)
    - mzmlDirectory (String): path to mzML/mgf files. Accepts multiple space-separated folder and files
    - pinPepXMLDirectory (String): path to pin files. Accepts multiple space-separated folder and files.
      If using in FragPipe, place the pin and pepXML files in the same folder

While you can individually pass these parameters, it is easier to place one 
on each line of the paramsList file. Please refer to [msbooster_params.txt](msbooster_params.txt)
for a template.


## Optional parameters
The parameters below are for general use. Koina-specific parameters are in [the Koina documentation](Koina.md#command-line)
<details>
<summary>General input/output and processing</summary>
<ul>
  <li><code>paramsList (String)</code>: location to text file containing parameters for this run
  <li><code>fragger (String)</code>: file path of fragger.params file from the MSFragger run. MSBooster will read in multiple parameters
and adjust internal parameters based on them, such as fragment mass error tolerance and mass offsets
  <li><code>outputDirectory (String)</code>: where to output the new files
  <li><code>editedPin (String)</code>: MSBooster will name the new file based on the ones provided. For example, A.pin will have a counterpart 
called A_edited.pin. To change from the default of "edited", provide a new string here
  <li><code>renamePin (int)</code>: whether to generate a new pin file or rewrite the old one. Default here is 1, which will not overwrite. 
Setting this to 0 will overwrite the old pin file
  <li><code>deletePreds (boolean)</code>: whether to delete the files storing model predictions after finishing a succesful run. By default, set
to false. Set to true if you wish to delete these
  <li><code>loadingPercent (int)</code>: how often to report progress on tasks using a progress reporter. By default, set to 10, meaning an 
update will be printed every 10%. 
  <li><code>numThreads (int)</code>: number of threads to use. By default set to 0, which uses all available threads minus 1
  <li><code>splitPredInputFile (int)</code>: only used when DIA-NN predictions fail due to an out of memory error (137). By default, set
to 1, but you can increase this to specify how many smaller files the DIA-NN input file should be broken up into. Each
file will then be predicted sequentially, easy the memory burden
  <li><code>plotExtension (String)</code>: what file format plots should be in. png by default, and pdf is also allowed
  <li><code>features (String)</code>: list of features to be calculated. Case-sensitive, comm-separated without spaces in between.
Default is "predRTrealUnits,unweightedSpectralEntropy,deltaRTLOESS"
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Enabling, specifying, and loading predictions</summary>
<ul>

location here
  <li><code>RTPredFile (String)</code>: same as spectraPredFile, but for RT predictions
  <li><code>IMPredFile (String)</code>: same as spectraPredFile, but for IM predictions
  <li><code>spectraModel (String)</code>: which spectral prediction model to use
  <li><code>rtModel (String)</code>: same as spectraModel, but for RT

  <li><code>useTopFragments (boolean)</code>: whether to filter spectral prediction to the N highest intensity peaks (default true)
  <li><code>topFragments (int)</code>: up to how many predicted fragments should be used for feature calculation (default 20). Only 
applied if useTopFragments is true
  <li><code>useBasePeak (boolean)</code>: whether a lower limit should be applied to MS2 predictions to only use fragments with higher
intensity (default true)

this number of PSMs are available, linear regression is used instead
  <li><code>minLinearRegressionSize (int)</code>: minimum number of PSMs needed to attempt linear regression RT/IM calibration (default 10).
If fewer than this number of PSMs are available, no calibration is attempted

## Output files
 - .pin file with new features. By default, new pin files will be produced ending in "_edited.pin". The
 default features used are "unweighted_spectral_entropy", "delta_RT_loess", and "pred_RT_real_units". If ion mobility
 features are enabled, "delta_IM_loess" and "ion_mobility" will also be included
 - spectraRT.tsv and spectraRT_full.tsv: input files for DIA-NN prediction model
 - spectraRT.predicted.bin: a binary file with predictions from DIA-NN to be used by MSBooster for 
feature calculation. If using FragPipe-PDV, these files are used to generate mirror plots of experimental
and predicted spectra

## Graphical output files
MSBooster produces multiple graphs that can be used to further examine how your data compares to model
predictions.
 - MSBooster_plots folder:
    - RT_calibration_curves: up to the top 5000 PSMs will be used for calibration between the 
    experimental and predicted RT scales. These top PSMs are presented in the graph, not all PSMs. 
    One graph will be produced per pin file
    ![Alt text](README_imgs/rt_calibration.png?raw=true)
    - IM_calibration_curves: up to the top 1000 PSMs will be used for calibration between the
      experimental and predicted IM scales. These top PSMs are presented in the graph, not all PSMs. A separate curve
      will be learned for each charge state. The figure below is an example for charge 2 precursors
    ![Alt text](README_imgs/im_calibration_charge2.png?raw=true)
    - score_histograms: overlayed histograms of all target and decoy PSMs for each pin file. Some 
    features are plotted here on a log scale for better visualization of the bimodal distribution of
    true and false positives, but the original value is what is used in the pin files, not the log-scaled
    version. Shown here are histograms for the unweighted spectral entropy and delta RT scores, but similar ones are
    produced for all features
